### Gitflow
Branches naming convention:
* **feat**: Branch with new functionalities
* **fix**: Branch with some fixes
* **hotfix**: Branch with urgent fixes (should be merged into develop and master)

Commit message prefix should be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

Example:
```shell
feat(auth-service): changing auth method
```
